Run multiple sequence alignment on commandline after downloading muscle5.1




wish I could get identity matrix from the alignment. maybe try clustalo?

$ cd /mnt/c/Users/Mathew/My\ Drive/LauraRogers/TCR_Repertoire
$ ~/./clustalo-1.2.4 -i testing/full-seqs.fa -o testing/full-seqs.clustalo.aln.fa --threads 8 -v --distmat-out testing/full-seqs.clustalo.distmat --percent-id --full --force

Use Jalview to view the alignments
